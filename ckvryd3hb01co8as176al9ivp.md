## Ongoing & Upcoming Hackathons and Coding Challenges - November edition

Hackathons are a great place to learn, build, discover new ideas and make new friends too. You will also agree with me that the empowerment of individuals is a key part of what makes open source community work since, in the end, innovations tend to come from small groups created during events like Hackathons. 

In order for you to take part in a Coding and programming challenge, you will need to find a good event for you, which will not only give you exposure but also give you an opportunity to meet an amazing team of developers globally. 

We have a tone of links about these events, which may seem tiresome going through, in this article I have collected a list of Hackathons happening this November, which is a result of organizations who have teamed up to create opportunities for developers to not only learn but also win the amazing gift and swag üòç, who doesn't love them.
