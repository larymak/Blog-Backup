## Developer Communities to Join to Help You Grow Your Tech Career.

> Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much. 
                      Helen Keller 

Over the past few years, we have seen lots of developer communities come into the rise with different goals and missions, but you will agree with me that they all have one thing in common, 
* Help each other learn,
* Share ideas
* Offer support to newbies and
* freely interact.  

We have different types of communities, front-end based communities, back-end based, specific language-based and we also have general communities which include all the above under one platform.  

Benefits offered by these communities are 'on another level' as I would say. They have helped people start from scratch to landing jobs in big tech companies like Google and Microsoft, they have raised mentors, helped improve people's code writing and reviewing skills, in other words, it has made programming easier to learn and master. 

Now to better help those looking for a good community to join according to your skills, I gathered a few of the top communities depending on your skills either front-end, back-end, blogging, and more to help you get started and meet your fellow developers. 

I may have not included all the communities out there because we have a ton of them, be free to add them up in the comment section to help others out:

### Conclusion 
I think you will agree with me is that not all developer communities are the same, although we have this now we can be assured to have others in the near future. 

But what they will all share are the community guidelines, no matter which you join you have to be respectful to each other. 

Each community has something to offer, take a look at the one that falls into your expertise and meet your fellow developers. 

Got another community you think is worth sharing, add it in the comments below and we will visit it.
