## Choosing The Right Python Framework for Web Development

Python is by far one of the easier to learn programming language, that's what most python developers say and I absolutely agree with them. It is not only easy but also covers almost every field of development and technology, from Web development, App, Machine learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence you name them..  
In order for python as a language to be able to complete some of the above tasks it requires help, at least we all at some point need help. For python it will need it from **Frameworks**  
## What Is A Framework?  
A framework is a collection of packages or modules which allow developers to write web applications, It fills in as a reflection tool that makes it simpler to build up the applications and reuse the code.   
In python we have three main types of frameworks: 
1. Fullstack framework - This is a one-stop solution for all developer requirements, such as form generators, form validation and template layouts
1. Micro-frameworks - These are light weight frameworks that do not offer additional functionality. Developers who use this need to add a lot of code.
1. Asynchronous - It is a micro-framework that allows developers to handle a set of concurrent connections.  

### Top Python Frameworks for Web Development  
Some of the best Python web frameworks for Web application Development. Here are the top Python frameworks. Python Frameworks to Learn in 2021 
1. Django  
It is a fullstack framework, free and an open source, It follows the DRY principle (Do Not Repeat Yourself). It takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.  
#### Quick Highlights  
ðŸš€ Ridiculously fast.  
ðŸš€ Reassuringly secure.  
ðŸš€ Exceedingly scalable.  
ðŸš€ Incredibly versatile.

1. Flask  
It is a microframework for Python dependent on Werkzeug, and Jinja 2. The primary intention is to build up a solid web application base. When contrasted with Django, Flask is most appropriate for little and simple activities.  
#### Quick Highlights  
ðŸš€ powerful automatic HTML escaping system for XSS prevention  
ðŸš€ template inheritance  
ðŸš€ compiles down to the optimal python code just in time  
ðŸš€ easy to debug.

1. CherryPy  
A Minimalist Python Web Framework, allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This results in smaller source code developed in less time.  
#### Quick Highlights   
ðŸš€ A reliable, HTTP/1.1-compliant, WSGI thread-pooled webserver.  
ðŸš€ Easy to run multiple HTTP servers at once.  
ðŸš€ A flexible plugin system.  
ðŸš€ Runs on Python 2.7+, 3.5+, PyPy, Jython, and Android.  
ðŸš€ Built-in profiling, coverage, and testing support.

1. TurboGears  
TurboGears is built on top of the experience of several next-generation web frameworks including Django and Rails.  
#### Quick Highlights   
ðŸš€ Starts as a microframework and scales up to a full-stack solution  
ðŸš€ Code that is as natural as writing a function  
ðŸš€ A powerful and flexible Object Relational Mapper (ORM) with real multi-database support  
ðŸš€ Designer-friendly template system great for programmers 
ðŸš€ Support for multiple data-exchange formats

1. Pyramid  
Pyramid makes it easy to write web applications. Pyramid offers many features that make writing complex software take less effort.  
Pyramid works in all supported versions of Python.  
#### Quick Highlights   
ðŸš€ Culture of 100% test and documentation coverage  
ðŸš€ Top-notch performance  
ðŸš€ Choose from a variety of templates, databases, security solutions

### Conclusion  
The above-listed frameworks are the broadly utilized full-stack and non-full stack backend web application development frameworks of Python.   
Every framework has its very own upsides and downsides  
I truly trust that you've discovered a fascinating framework with regard to this article.  
With the expanding utilization of web applications, the interest for these frameworks is by all accounts expanding more and new technologies are being implemented.  
Hope you find your weapon from the listed ones above
