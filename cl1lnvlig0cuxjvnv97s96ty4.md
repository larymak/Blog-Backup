## Python Project Ideas to Improve Your Résumé

Every project is an opportunity to learn – figure out problems and challenges and invent and reinvent.

And as a developer, working on projects can improve not only your skills but also your résumé – which can increase your chances of getting that dream job.

Have you ever come across a job description that requires candidates to have a certain number of years of experience? I have – actually almost every job advert that I come across. These job descriptions can lower your self-esteem and make you feel underqualified, especially if you're a fresh graduate or just learning to code.

So, what happens when you don't have any work experience in the tech industry and you want to apply for a job? Well, the answer is simple – your portfolio is everything. You just have to use your past projects (and maybe build some new ones) to help you stand out.

In this guide, we will go through how to use experience from your projects to help you with your job applications. Our focus will be on some of the major Python projects that can help boost your résumé in a job environment.

## Why Build Projects in Python?
You can use Python in many ways, including software and web development, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Knowing Python is a valuable skill for a coder. But if you're new to coding, it can be difficult to demonstrate your expertise on a résumé when you are applying for jobs.

Completing Python projects that you can clearly describe and that a hiring manager can look at is a great way to showcase your skills

If you aren’t sure how to write a résumé or your résumé needs a complete revamp, there are multiple resources online to help you out:

Now, here are some ideas for Python projects that you can showcase on your résumé.

### 1. Server Status Checker
A server status checker is a script that will let you monitor if your server is active and running. It can show you how much downtime your server has had and give you regular updates on its performance. It'll also send immediate alerts when the server is down.

Some of the tools that come in handy when developing such a script include:

* Socket - helps with connection to different servers.
* SSL - required for wrapping the socket connection.
* Date & Time - Check what time the server is active or went down.
* smtplib - Send email alerts when the server is down.
* Pickle - Saves the history of the server performance.
